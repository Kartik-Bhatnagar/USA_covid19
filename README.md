# USA_covid19
This python Notebook shows the analysis of Covid 19 cases in United Stes Of America

The Analysis is centerd around Chloropleth Maps.

Visualization  of Covid 19 cases spread and deaths across USA (District Wise and State Wise is shown)

Vaccination rate is shown (State Wise)

Vizualization of 3 features in Single Chloropleth is Being Shown. ( 1. R-value, 2. Vaccination Rate , 3. Current Daily Cases)

Vizualization of 4 features in Single Chloropleth is also Being Shown. ( 1. R-value, 2. Vaccination Rate , 3. Current Daily Cases, 4 Current Daily Death Cases )
[see it in screen_shot2]

Correlation between R-vale (reproduction Value) and Vaccination rate is also obtaines and the anser to the following query is being answered

**Query -   if more people are vaccinated is the disease transmission under control ?
   is the R-value less for those states  based on fully vaccinated people (%)**

**Ans.**It bold text's Quite evident from the table that there is no relation between R-Vale and vaccination rate.

The States having very good vaccination rate has also very high R- value (Eg. Vermont State , this state has currently the highest Vaccination rate but R-value of this sate is very high)

On the other hand States having poor Vaccination Rate also observes to have low R-value.

And also the correlation value shows that they are negatively correlated and that too not strongly.

According to this Explored data if more people are vaccinated then its **not** looking like that disease is under controll
